Update: January 2023 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 20 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece asked us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so now you can stay in Chicago in our art filled Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether you'd like to enjoy an ouzo in Athens overlooking the Acropolis the Acropolis View Alpha or 7 bedroom  Acropolis SkyVilla, or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago while staying at  our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed. 

All of our places are perfect for 3 generation families, multiple couples (especially in Athens pre or post cruise), or groups of friends on a city break or vacation.

Υόρκη στη δεκαετία του '80, είμαι δασκάλα χορού και ψυχοθεραπεύτρια. Έχω δημιουργήσει η ίδια, σχεδιάζοντας, διακοσμώντας και επιβλέποντας την ανακατασκευή κτισμάτων, όπως το στούντιό μου και το σπίτι μου.  Ξέρω έτσι τη διαδικασία της δημιουργίας και πόσο κόπο και χρήματα απαιτεί. Σέβομαι, είμαι υπεύθυνη ως προς τον χώρο  και μ' αρέσει να ζω σε όμορφο αισθητικά περιβάλλον με ενδιαφέροντες ανθρώπους. Δεν καπνίζω και προσπαθώ να ζω υγιεινά. Χρειάζομαι η κατοικία που βρίσκομαι να είναι καθαρή, να έχει τάξη αλλά και προσωπικότητα. Το σημαντικότερο όλων όμως για μένα είναι η θετική αλληλεπίδραση και η καλή επικοινωνία με τους ανθρώπους που έρχομαι σ' επαφή. Αγαπώ τις διαφορετικές κουλτούρες και εμπνέομαι απο την τέχνη, τον πολιτισμό. Είμαι αυτόνομος και συνεννοήσιμος άνθρωπος. Ζω μια γεμάτη ζωή στην πόλη μου.
Δεν μπορώ να ζω χωρίς την τέχνη, τη φύση, τις ζεστές σχέσεις, την ομορφιά, την αλλαγή και την εξέλιξη. Πηγαίνω τακτικά σε ταινίες κυρίως σινεφίλ, ακούω μουσική απο κλασική, μέχρι τζαζ, ροκ, ethnic, alternative rock, διαβάζω λογοτεχνία, ψυχολογία και ιστορία. Κάνω διαλογισμό μέσα απο την κίνηση για μένα και διδάσκοντας η ίδια-έχω εκπαιδεύσει πολύ κόσμό 27 χρόνια τώρα στην Ελλάδα και στο εξωτερικό. Θα με βρείτε σχετικά στο www.presentbody.com. Ως προς το φαγητό, χρειάζομαι η όμορφη γεύση να συνδυάζεται με υγιεινή διατροφή, προσπαθώ να μην τρώω συχνά κρέας και να αποφεύγω τα γαλακτοκομικά. Ως επισκέπτης είμαι υπεύθυνη, προσαρμόσιμη  και ξέρω να βάζω τα όρια μου όταν βλέπω πως μια κατάσταση δεν ανταποκρίνεται σε αυτό που χρειάζομαι. Ως οικοδεσπότης προσφέρω φροντίδα και φιλική επικοινωνία ώστε να νοιώσει ο άλλος άνετα. Βοηθάω τον ξένο σε αυτά που χρειάζεται και ακούω τις ανάγκες του. Του δίνω χώρο να γνωρίσει την καθημερινότητά μου ανάλογα με τη σχέση που έχω μαζί του. Ουσιαστικά κάθε φορά χρειάζεται να ""μετράω"" την απόσταση που κάνει και τους δύο να αισθάνονται όμορφα και λειτουργικά. Τα ταξίδιά μου συνήθως συνδυάζουν τη δουλειά(διδασκω στο εξωτερικό) με την απόλαυση που έχει κανείς όταν αλλάζει τόπο διαμονής, έστω και για λίγο. Έχω ταξιδέψει σε πολλές χώρες της Ευρώπης, Αμερική, και Ασία. 

Since early on in my life, I travel abroad, visiting other countries, getting familiar with their history and culture. During the 80s, I studied contemporary dance in NYC where I lived for 4 years. I am an international dance teacher and body psychotherapist. I have passion for the creation of space; thus, I have renovated and got personally involved with the reconstruction and decoration of various spaces including Present Body dance/movement studio and my flat. Having all this experience, I appreciate beauty and well-being; I enjoy living amongst interesting, cultured people; the quality of inner and outer environment is very important to me. I try to live respectful to my body and the place that surrounds me. Thus, I don’t smoke, and I enjoy good communication with the people that I meet. I love the arts, being in nature; I am open to new acquaintances, relationships that offer a ground of warmth, respect and  creativity.

I have been living in Athens since I was born.I love going out so I know every place you should visit.I personally prefer to have a good time without spending a fortune.I prefer to move around the city by bicycle or public transport since everything is nearby.
My favourite leisure activity is listening to music,watching movies and riding my bike.
I have obtained a degree in Statistics at the University of Economics and Business in Athens.
I also adore the sea and my passion is sailing. Moreover,I cooperate with a company which is specialised in cruise day trips.

I am a very easy going person, always willing to meet new people, travel, learn and explore new things. Always eager to experience new adventures, places, countries, cultures or even good food. A few things i love and can't do without would have to be the sea, and the harmony and peace that comes with it..the sun and the amazing Greek sunsets/sunrises that you can never get or see enough of them...and there is also my active side and my rush for adrenaline..

 There are quite a few extreme sports that i am in to..such as: off road motorbike riding: enduro and motocross..riding up the mountains to reach the highest point and check out the view..or riding through a dense forest and feel the fresh air, along a river and experience a humid or wet ride or even  down the motocross track for a few laps...i also like to surf and SUP, skate and cycle a lot. In general i like to be active and enjoy life and always up to experience new things!

I am Alexandros, an ex-financier who turned into an entrepreneur.

I grew up in Athens, Greece, an awesome and vibrant city, where I studied Civil Engineering at NTUA. I was always keen on music, a passion which I flipped into DJing, yeap!!! Following my graduation I wanted to see the world and study abroad, so I attended Columbia University in NYC for my second Masters degree. The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

After some years in corporate environments I decided to follow my real love, which is creating things from scratch, so I quit my job and alongside with my brother, George, we began a hospitality start-up.

We provide unique furnished apartments by offering personalized services!

It is so awesome to be an explorer and we believe that if you do not travel is like reading only the cover of the book. Hence,  t-r-a-v-e-l  :)

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

I grew up in Athens, Greece, an awesome and vibrant city, where I studied Civil Engineering at NTUA. I was always keen on music, a passion which I flipped into DJing, yeap!!! Following my graduation I wanted to see the world and study abroad, so I attended Columbia University in NYC for my second Masters degree. The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

After some years in corporate environments I decided to follow my real love, which is creating things from scratch, so I quit my job and alongside with my brother, George, we began a hospitality start-up.

We provide unique furnished apartments by offering personalized services!

I am Alexandros, an ex-financier who turned into an entrepreneur.

I grew up in Athens, Greece, an awesome and vibrant city, where I studied Civil Engineering at NTUA. I was always keen on music, a passion which I flipped into DJing, yeap!!! Following my graduation I wanted to see the world and study abroad, so I attended Columbia University in NYC for my second Masters degree. The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

After some years in corporate environments I decided to follow my real love, which is creating things from scratch, so I quit my job and alongside with my brother, George, we began a hospitality start-up.

We provide unique furnished apartments by offering personalized services!

It is so awesome to be an explorer and we believe that if you do not travel is like reading only the cover of the book. Hence,  t-r-a-v-e-l  :)

I enjoy football and alternative sports, but also reading good books and of course activities like puzzles and escape rooms, things I do for a living!
I have travelled all over Europe and Africa and I consider Paris and Budapest my favourite destinations, places of history but also modern and cosmopolitan, having many things to see and do.
Films and TV shows about historic events and murder mysteries are my favorite and recently I got infatuated with Money Heist (“La casa de Papel”). while my literature of choice is mainly classic and timeless. I could not imagine myself as I am today without having read “Around the World in 80 Days” in my childhood!
I enjoy Mediterranean and Greek traditional cuisine, but I would like to taste every culinary tradition the world has to offer.

I really like meeting new people from all over the world while travelling or, even better, having them visit Athens and hosting them! I am energetic and forward-thinking (or so my friends and colleagues say about me), a physical as well as intellectual person. I enjoy football and alternative sports, but also reading good books and of course activities like puzzles and escape rooms, things I do for a living!
I have travelled all over Europe and Africa and I consider Paris and Budapest my favourite destinations, places of history but also modern and cosmopolitan, having many things to see and do.
Films and TV shows about historic events and murder mysteries are my favorite and recently I got infatuated with Money Heist (“La casa de Papel”). while my literature of choice is mainly classic and timeless. I could not imagine myself as I am today without having read “Around the World in 80 Days” in my childhood!

We are Maria & Alex, the founders, both engineers. So we were already working together in the design & construction sector, so we  dealt with properties all the time. We are both into details, both love doing something right from scratch.

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on nocarz!

Update: January 2023 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 20 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece asked us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so now you can stay in Chicago in our art filled Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether you'd like to enjoy an ouzo in Athens overlooking the Acropolis the Acropolis View Alpha or 7 bedroom  Acropolis SkyVilla, or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago while staying at  our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed. 

All of our places are perfect for 3 generation families, multiple couples (especially in Athens pre or post cruise), or groups of friends on a city break or vacation.

The Greek word ""ΦΙΛΟΞΕΝΙΑ=hospitality"" is of a particular importance in the Greek culture. It’s a compound word from ""ΦΙΛΩ=LOVE"" and ""ΞΕΝΟΣ=GUEST "" and refers to the act of nestling and caring of a guest by the host. It was an institution for the ancient Greeks to welcome and take care of the guests at their home. They believed particularly in the idea of hospitality and regarded it as a moral duty and a sacred rule of the gods (Xenios Zeus was the protector of the guests). They offered them bath and sleep and they greeted them with gifts. The host and the guest were linked with friendly ties, which where inherited to their descendants. 
This is our inheritance.

I really like meeting new people from all over the world while travelling or, even better, having them visit Athens and hosting them! I am energetic and forward-thinking (or so my friends and colleagues say about me), a physical as well as intellectual person. I enjoy football and alternative sports, but also reading good books and of course activities like puzzles and escape rooms, things I do for a living!
I have travelled all over Europe and Africa and I consider Paris and Budapest my favourite destinations, places of history but also modern and cosmopolitan, having many things to see and do.
Films and TV shows about historic events and murder mysteries are my favorite and recently I got infatuated with Money Heist (“La casa de Papel”). while my literature of choice is mainly classic and timeless. I could not imagine myself as I am today without having read “Around the World in 80 Days” in my childhood!
I enjoy Mediterranean and Greek traditional cuisine, but I would like to taste every culinary tradition the world has to offer.

As my father’s family is from Santorini I spent all my summers there. Since I am a licensed tour guide, in 2004 I decided to move to Santorini in order to work there. This was a great chance to start renovating my family’s properties in order to be able to share them with people from all over the world. 

In addition, many years ago, my mother visited the island of Patmos, fell in love with it and decided to buy two beautiful pieces of land, including very old farmhouses in ruinous condition, that she slowly renovated. In this way, our family and numerous friends enjoyed many unforgettable Patmos Easters and summers. Nowadays, I am responsible for the good condition of the houses that I rent out and share the beauty and special ambiance of this island with our guests.

I am very lucky since my twin daughters, Alexandra and Christina, having completed their studies abroad in hospitality management and tourism, returned to their roots in order to continue and develop what I started.  Genuine hospitality, love and respect for the island, as well as the embracement of the local culture define our core values. Nowadays we all share our time between Santorini, Patmos and Athens, and have the honor and pleasure to share our family’s story and our love for these islands, with visitors from all over the world. 

After many years in the hospitality industry, today I have the pleasure along with my daughters to embrace one more much loved island home, my husband's summer house on the island of Hydra. The house was built by my father in law 40 years ago. My husband Dimitris will be managing the house in Hydra.
